<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dynamics-of-discontinuous-change">The Dynamics Of Discontinuous Change</h2>
<p>There aren’t that many universals in life. One of the few – and one of the most important when it comes to understanding how change occurs – is the s-curve. S-curves describe how all systems evolve.</p>
<p>Whatever the system exists to do – the outcomes it delivers – when it first appears, it tends not to be effective. If it does sufficient, sufficiently better than its alternatives, then effort is expended to improve its effectiveness. At first, this effort reaps rich rewards. A small amount of effort delivers considerable improvement in the system. If this job is done for a long enough period of time, the system evolves past a tipping point and begins to be attractive to more and more users. A virtuous cycle appears. This virtuous cycle creates the steepest rising part of the s-curve. Life is good. Each bit of improvement effort that goes in to the system, delivers a higher level of improvement. And then it doesn’t. The curve reaches a point where the slope of the curve stops increasing and begins to decrease. More and more effort is expended, and each new piece of that effort delivers a progressively smaller improvement in the effectiveness of the system. The virtuous cycle no longer appears to be working, and a new, vicious, cycle kicks in. The harder people try to improve the system, the more the vicious-cycle fights back, The curve gets flatter and flatter, until, if improvement work continues long enough, it becomes totally flat. No matter how much new improvement effort is made, the system remains fundamentally stuck in what it will deliver back again.</p>
<p>This vicious cycle is all about the emergence and strengthening of contradictions. The reason the top of an s-curve gets flat is not because we stop trying to improve its effectiveness, but because something comes along and stops us.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1 S-Curves &amp; Virtuous/Vicious Cycles</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to many decades of ‘operational excellence’ and the deployment of improvement tools and methods like Lean and Six Sigma, today’s world finds itself with a very large proportion of businesses sitting at the top of their respective s-curves. The problem for all of them is that all of the tools, methods and strategies that allowed the s-curve to be climbed no longer work. Optimization no longer works when we’re sat at the top of the s-curve. Most organisations have no idea what to do when they hit this position. The usual reaction is to work the optimization tools even harder. The problem is that the top of the s-curve defines a fundamental limit of the current system. Fundamental, unfortunately for all of the enterprises that find themselves at the top of their curve, means precisely that. We could optimize the system from today to eternity and not make the slightest improvement beyond the fundamental limit. People get frustrated. Managers get angry. No-one likes beating their head against a wall for too long.</p>
<p>The only answer is to solve the contradiction. Most enterprises have no idea that such things are possible. That’s because everything everyone has been taught – through school, college and, worst of all, MBA programmes – is how to make trade-offs. Trade-offs are generally speaking seen as bad. That’s why we’ve been taught to call it ‘optimization’. That sounds much better. But it is totally different to ‘solving the contradiction’. Everyone knows ‘you can’t have your cake and eat it’, but some people choose not to accept it. These are the innovators. The people that will come along and put your organisation out of business.</p>
<p>For the most part, they won’t be your current competitors. That’s because they’re busy ‘optimizing’ too. Most innovation comes from outsiders to the industry. That happens because very often the newcomers are too dumb to know that they can’t have your cake and eat it. They come along and solve the contradiction while you’re still running your latest Design Of Experiments charade.</p>
<p>The Business Matrix is a distillation of all of the people who decided not to accept the trade-offs, the people that decided they were going to have their cake and eat it, and somehow prevailed. Just over nine million of them at the time of writing. Shortly, we’ll examine some of them in a bit more detail in order to see how the Matrix has been built and refined over the last twenty years.</p>
<p>For the moment, the emphasis is on the relationship between contradiction solving and s-curves. It’s rare for me to encounter people that haven’t heard of s-curves these days. Most people, too, seem to be able to intellectualise why they look like they do.</p>
<p>But then, somehow, when it comes to connecting it to themselves, the work they do, and the systems they operate within, something seems to go awry.</p>
<p>Try and talk about how the spread of technology always gives an s-shaped curve and people seem to be able to picture what’s happening. Innovator’s, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards. Some customers come to the party earlier than others.</p>
<p>But then try and apply the same s-curve thinking to things like staff engagement, or customer trust, or Net Promoter Scores, or ‘value demand’, or how productive they’re able to be during a working day, or quality improvement programmes, and a disconnect occurs.</p>
<p>When enterprises try and improve how much customers ‘trust’ them, nothing will happen unless there is a system to make it happen. Admittedly it will be a complex system. That’s complexity as in the mathematical sense – something else we’ll dig deeper into later on too.</p>
<p>Things like ‘trust’ are emergent properties of complex systems. Everything feels like it effects everything else, and usually in unpredictable ways. That may be so, but it’s a system nonetheless. It may not give us the level of trust we desire, but if it doesn’t, the reason it hasn’t is because ‘the system’ has hit the top of the s-curve. And therefore the vicious cycle. And the contradiction.</p>
<p>Again, as we’ll see shortly, there are multiple strategies and methods for revealing which vicious cycles and contradictions are causing you to be stuck at the top of your own curve. One of the simplest, however, requires us to ask just two simple questions. Question 1, what are you trying to improve? Question 2, what’s stopping you? If you can answer those two questions, you’re well on your way to being able to tap into the nine million and some other people that have been in the same place before you, and successfully found a way of solving the contradiction and thus jumping their system to its next curve.</p>
<p>That, ultimately, is how the world of change works. Someone creates a system. They optimize it. They get stuck. Someone solves the contradiction. This creates a new s-curve. Someone then optimizes that s-curve. They too eventually get stuck. Then someone comes along and solves their contradiction. Looked at through an s-curve lens, the world looks something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2 S-Curves &amp; Alternating Innovation/Optimization Cycles</strong></p>
<p>It’s a picture that should tell us that there are times in life when optimization is the right thing to be doing, and there are other times when our job becomes solving contradictions. It’s not an either/or. Things like Lean and SixSigma have a very definite place in life. When we’re looking to optimize the system (climb the curve), they probably help do the job better than anything. When we’re looking to jump curve, we need to put those methods on one side and pick up others. Solving contradictions means we need tools for solving contradictions. Most people assume there is no such toolkit. The Business Matrix is an attempt to show them such tools do exist. When we’re stuck at the top of our current curve, we no longer have to accept the fact that we’re stuck.</p>
<p>Some people think that this process of discontinuously jumping from one s-curve to the next is called ‘innovation’. In our terms, they’re probably right. Innovation is all about people that have made a discontinuous jump successfully.</p>
<p>But because s-curves are literally everywhere, some discontinuous jumps are bigger than others. Almost everyone will recognise that the jump from land-line to cellular telephony was a step-change. When we zoom in and look then at, say, the jump from handsets with keypads to those with touchscreens, that was more about ‘optimization’ than innovation. Even though it very definitely, when we look closely enough, involved a discontinuous jump. Zoom in further and we can see that Apple only entered the touchscreen world when the technology allowed the user to do something more than point at something on the screen. We all know that the way to make text bigger or smaller on our smartphone screen is to use two fingers that we either move apart or together. That looks even more like ‘optimization’, but it was, again, if we zoom-in close enough, another s-curve jumping step change. Step-change, in other words, is in the eyes of the designer. If you were a keypad designer, touchscreens were a whole world away from anything you knew. Likewise, if you were designing screens with that allowed you to recognise where on the screen the user was touching it, that was a world away from someone that had worked out how quickly the user was moving their finger could give a whole new set of benefits. S-curves are literally everywhere. All we need to do to find them all is work out that they co-exist hierarchically. Some sit at the top of the hierarchy, are global and visible to all, some sit at the bottom of the hierarchy and are only visible to those that look through a progressively finer and finer microscope:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3 S-Curves Hierarchies</strong></p>
<p>‘So what?’ you ask. You might not care about s-curves. Your job is merely to improve what your boss told you to improve. You might not know that your ability to improve is governed by your position on your current curve. You might not know where you are on your curve. It would be better if you did. Nothing works like understanding how the world works. Maybe the only bit you need to know right now is that if you’re trying to make the improvement, and every time you do something prevents you… something like this…</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4 Corporate Whack-A-Mole &amp; Contradictions</strong></p>
<p>… you’re at the top of your curve, you’re caught in a vicious cycle, and if you really want to go back to your boss with an actual improvement, your only alternative right now is to solve the contradiction.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history-evolution-of-the-business-matrix">History &amp; Evolution Of The Business Matrix</h2>
<p>Like nearly all major discoveries, the concept of a Contradiction Matrix emerged by accident. When an engineer in the Soviet Navy began searching through patent documents in 1946 (Reference 1), he wasn’t the first person to recognise the importance of contradictions. That honour probably resides with the so-called ‘Gang Of Three’ philosophers of Ancient Greece. Aristotle, Plato and, particularly, Socrates, pontificated seemingly endlessly about the socal ed dialectic. Socrates essentially believed that a contradiction was best solved through dialogue, enough of which would eventually determine which perspective was right and which was wrong. It was – and still is – essentially a method of clever questioning aimed, ultimately, at browbeating the weaker opponent into submission. Most modern political and legal systems are still built around this Dialectic Method.</p>
<p>More recently, the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) took the Gang Of Threes ideas a step further by realizing that sometimes, both sides of an argument can ‘right’ and that the best solution in such cases was to find a higher level ‘synthesis’ solution that allowed both thesis and antithesis to both remain true, rather than have the two opposing sides bludgeon each other into submission. Hegel effectively invented ‘third-way’ politics, but, fair to say, the majority of politicians, lawyers and business leaders still don’t get it. Hegel’s thesis-antithesis-synthesis model, however, at least offered those that were open-minded enough the possibility of actually solving their contradictions.</p>
<p>But it was only in the patent research conducted by Genrich Altshuller starting from 1946 that the true significance of contradiction-solving became apparent. Altshuller was, crudely speaking, tasked with distinguishing ‘good’ patents from ‘bad’ ones. He very quickly saw that the key factor differentiating one from the other was whether the inventor had successfully solved a contradiction or had merely made the usual win-lose trade-offs that everyone else did. Most patents fell into the latter trade-off-method ‘bad’ category. These patents, Altshuller concluded, could safely be ignored. The patents to focus on were the ones where the inventors had decided to persist beyond the trade-offs their peers had accepted and had successfully ‘eliminated’ them. Whenever Altshuller or a member of his team saw such a patent, they started reverse engineering the strategies the inventors had used to achieve their no-trade-off solutions. After a year, they began to realise there weren’t very many of these contradiction-solving strategies, and the foundations of the inventive problem solving method the world now knows as ‘TRIZ’ were born. Not long after that, they realized that inventors in different industries were all effectively solving the same problems and, when they solved them well, they used exactly the same strategies. And so the first Contradiction Matrix was born. It started by building a taxonomy of all the contradicting parameters inventors were trying to unravel, and then, for each conflicting pair of parameters, Altshuller’s team collated all of the different conflict-breaking solutions and their underlying strategies.</p>
<p>Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix research is today is clouded in considerable mystery and mythologizing. To this day, the original research – insert images of warehouses full of patent documents neatly classified and analysed – has not been made available for scrutiny. What is clear, though, is that by the early 1970s, Altshuller declared that work on the Matrix should cease. Some of his acolytes say the decision was made because the Matrix was ‘finished’ – as in ‘perfect and not to be tampered with any more’ – while others will vociferously argue that the termination occurred because either, a) the basic concept of the Matrix was flawed, or, more typically, b) because it was such darned hard work reading through patent documents to try and reveal the necessary contradiction solving ‘DNA’.</p>
<p>Spool the clock forward, now, to the late 1990s when the Systematic Innovation research team was formed and tasked with the job of ‘updating’ the original TRIZ contradiction research. The work was instigated because attempts to use the 1970s Soviet Contradiction Matrix often proved to be frustrating. Use it to try and solve a mechanical problem and it would usually ‘work’; use it to try and solve a semi-conductor problem, or a pharmaceutical problem, or a problem in any of the ‘modern’ industries and it would usually either point problem solvers in fruitless or nonsensical directions. The overall concept of ‘find-the-contradiction-solve-the-contradiction’ seemed more and more valid the more problems we worked with clients on, it was the detail contained within the Contradiction Matrix that was wrong. By 2003, working in conjunction with some of the key members of Altshuller’s team (Genrich Altshuller had sadly passed away in 1998), and adding close to a million additional patent analyses, it was possible to publish a completely new version of the Matrix (Reference 2). Matrix 2003 had a slow start across the TRIZ user-community – it took the academic community, and a fairly peripheral element of the community at that close to a decade to confirm that the new Matrix was superior to the original. By which time the Systematic Innovation research team, now aided by some smart semantic search software, had added several million more patent analyses and had published Matrix 2010 (Reference 3). Nowadays, search technology means we can effectively build an in situ, bespoke Matrix on the fly, albeit, this is in no small part made possible by the stability of the 2010 version of the tool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in parallel with all of this work on the ‘technical’ version of the Contradiction Matrix, the team had also been working on a hypothesis that the concept of contradiction-solving was also highly relevant in the world of business, and that, as with technology, the best business solutions were ones in which the creators successfully challenged or eliminated trade-offs and compromises. At first – through the last three years of the 1990s – we were trying to confirm our, we now know, naïve belief that when business leaders and entrepreneurs ‘solve contradictions’ they would be using a whole bunch of different strategies to the ones used by technologists. At the end of this piece of work, the conclusion was that solving ‘business contradictions’ used precisely the same set of Inventive Principles that were used to solve ‘technology problems’. And, we later found, the same applied to IT, architecture, music, literature, politics, you-name-it, it’s the same basic 40 Principles. Now, even though the search continues, it feels like we’re somewhere near the end of the road. Much as we might like to re-structure and re-label Altshuller’s 40 Principles, it doesn’t look like we’ll ever find a 41st one.</p>
<p>So much for the strategies for solving business contradictions, next up we needed a taxonomy for defining the sorts of contradictions those working in the world of business were working on. A first version of that taxonomy – a 31x31 Matrix – was first revealed to the world in 2001 (Reference 4). It was built around 100,000 case study analyses. Where patents had been the main source of data for the technical tool, the equivalent in the world of business, turned out to be the management text book. Or, more rightly, the academic business literature out of which management texts tend to get spawned.</p>
<p>By 2004, we had sufficient verification and validation evidence from a brave lead community of Business Matrix users to justify expanding the research. Again, as in the world of technology, the decision was made easier through the emergence of semantic search technologies that allowed us to analyse lots of literature in a relatively short amount of time. We re-issued a new version of the Matrix that year. The 31x31 taxonomy still seemed to be somewhere about right, so the new Matrix – published in the first edition of Hands-On Systematic Innovation for Business &amp; Management (Reference 5), one of our ongoing best-sellers – was mainly about adding more data. 100,000 case studies had grown to a shade over quarter of a million.</p>
<p>And that near-enough brings us up to the present day. Research to keep adding new data to the Business Matrix has continued since 2004. In the most recent decade of this search, two phenomena have stood out. The first is the increasing level of dysfunction of the business literature ‘industry’ where, unlike the world of patents, copyright laws are a far less effective means of preventing authors from re-inventing the same wheels as earlier authors. Which is to say, the way things seem to work these days is once in a while, someone has a really useful insight. They write a paper about it. Then a book. Then, if competing publishers recognize the magnitude of the insight, they go find other authors to go and write their own version of the same basic story. So-called ‘Design Thinking’ is a classic case at the moment, with, at the time of writing, something like 1500 titles available on Amazon. All of them containing the same basic (contradiction-solving) insight that Edward De Bono wrote about in the late 1960s. Frustrating for prospective readers, and a potential minefield for the Systematic Innovation research team in terms of training our search tools to connect the newly invented words and phrases publishers tend to encourage, back to the original problems and solutions. This first phenomena, in other words, boils down to how well we can all see-through the publishing industry noise and get to the meaningful signal.</p>
<p>The second phenomena has been more interesting in terms of evolving the Matrix. Back in 2004, the world of business – at least in terms of how businesses were taught to be managed – was very much about tangibles. ‘What gets measured gets managed’ being the aphorism of choice for many middle-managers (and perhaps even more so, their bosses). Accountants and economists ruled the roost. If the economists said stand-up, everyone stood up. And then the 2008 GFC happened, and we all started to realise what our guts (and W. Edwards Deming) had been telling us for a long time, ‘the most important numbers are unknown and unknowable’. Business success, in other words, was increasingly all about the intangibles. It was about how much your customers (and your employees) trusted you. It was about our innate human desire for autonomy, belonging and desire to feel competent. The more this realization struck home, the more attention intangibles have received. In 2004, there was no repository of knowledge we could go and analyse to see how someone might have solved, say, an autonomy-versus-risk contradiction, but by 2010, we realized, there was enough of it to at least contemplate adding such ‘unmeasurable’ parameters into the Business Matrix taxonomy. By 2012, we’d worked on enough client projects to learn that things like autonomy and trust are in actual fact eminently measurable (hence our spin-out of the ‘PanSensic’ measurement tools), and, not long after that, that we could use those measurements to create and reverse engineer a statistically significant number of case studies to meaningfully populate a Matrix tool with this extended taxonomy. And so, here we are, with a new 45x45 size version of the Business Matrix – our ‘3.0’ version of the tool. A bigger, much more ‘intangibles’ focused tool and a lot more data, with, today, over three-quarters of a million business-focused case studies – thanks in no small part to a still increasing propensity for US business to at least attempt to patent their contradiction-solving business models and concept innovations. And thanks too, finally, to the recently released PanSensic ‘Contradiction Finder’ tool – a semantic narrative search tool that will automatically scrape through swathes of text (email traffic, social media, business literature, etc) to identify not just the conflicts and contradictions that people are talking about, but also, how they’re (occasionally – the business world still isn’t so good at this kind of ‘third-way’ stuff) able to deliver a contradiction-solving breakthrough solution.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-acquisition-methods">Data Acquisition Methods</h2>
<p>Since the first days of TRIZ, the process of building the Contradiction Matrix tools has involved reverse engineering millions of case studies. Once the decision was made to build a Matrix for business and management problems, the reverse engineering challenge increased considerably. The process is fraught with difficulties, the main one of which is complexity. Success – however such a thing might be defined – is an emergent property of a complex system. And in the world of business, where everything is increasingly connected to everything else, success becomes ever more fleeting. ‘If you always do what you’ve always done, you will always get what you’ve always got’ is still an oft used aphorism in business. In the context of complex systems, however, it is a potentially very dangerous way to view the world. Just ask the 400+ enterprises from the original Fortune500 of 1955 that no longer exist. They all failed because they steadfastly continued doing what had made them successful, even though the world around them had changed.</p>
<p>Even the most cursory of glances at The Halo Effect (Reference 6), one of the most disruptive management texts of the last twenty years, will tell readers that attempts to decode the reasons for the success of an enterprise very easily fall foul of mythology, ego and a mis-reading of a situation by outsiders. I’ve had much experience of the same problem when working with many Systematic Innovation clients over the last couple of decades. When Jack Welch was in charge of GE he (in)famously told the world that the Company had saved $9B as a result of deploying SixSigma. No-one in the Company, however, has ever been able to show me any of this money. What I have seen, on the other hand, is an internal recognition that attributing the success of your latest project to SixSigma was good for your career. And so – surprise, surprise – any and all kinds of success managed to have a SixSigma-did-this label attached to them. On no occasion, though, was there ever a project in which SixSigma was compared with any of a thousand-and-one other methods of thinking about system improvement. In other words, while I don’t doubt that GE has many breakthrough successes through and beyond Welch’s tenure, we should be extremely wary about any attempt to pin the success down to a ‘root cause’.</p>
<p>One of the key distinguishing attributes of any complex system is there is no such thing as a ‘root-cause’ of any emergent characteristic or feature. Success – or failure – emerges instead from a ‘conspiracy of causes’. Take away any one of these contributing ‘causes’ and there would be no success. Or rather, what would emerge would be something very different.</p>
<p>Success in a complex world can be very fleeting. A conspiracy of causes that lead to extraordinary non-linear growth one day can lead to abject failure the next. That’s why it can be highly dangerous – indeed why most management texts are dangerous – because they have fallen into the trap of reverse engineering a temporarily successful enterprise, have abstracted an apparent root-cause success formula and presented it to the world as some kind of universal panacea. Look at how Deming Prize winners uncannily fall off a cliff not long after they win; look at how many of the ‘great’ enterprises in Good To Great (Reference 7) stopped being great after Jim Collins wrote about them; look at how faddish twelve-step programs come and go (or how twelve steps has shrunk to six or four or, in the case of Net Promoter Score, one).</p>
<p>You can never step in the same river twice. What worked for one enterprise probably won’t work for another. Even though they might look superficially ‘the same’.</p>
<p>The situation sounds hopeless. If it’s really true we can never step in the same river twice (it is), we should never hope to be able to decode the success of one enterprise and hope to be able to transfer it to another. Fortunately, the original TRIZ researchers found something important. They didn’t understand complex systems, but when we combine what they learned with what we now know about complexity, we end up with the foundations on which we have a chance of understanding universal patterns of success. It all comes down to the aforementioned s-curves and specifically the sequence of vicious cycle at the top of the current curve creating the opportunity for bifurcations. The right combination of bifurcation and environment then creates a new virtuous cycle that in turn allows the new solution to prevail and eventually supersede the old system. At least for a while… until the next (inevitable) vicious cycle kicks into play.</p>
<p>The vicious-cycle-bifurcation-virtuous-cycle sequence is all about contradictions. Emergence of contradictions, emergence of a ‘root contradiction’ and the eventual resolution of that contradiction. The right – i.e.&nbsp;universally transferable – research to do, therefore, is looking for contradictions and how enterprises eventually resolve and eliminate them.</p>
<p>This gives us at least the start of a research formula: look for a non-linearly successful entity; look for the contradictions that got solved in order to create the virtuous cycle driving the non-linearity; look for how the contradiction was solved.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of what that process looks like in practice:</p>
<p><strong>The Geography Of Genius:</strong> Once in a while, you find yourself in the presence of an author that understands complexity and how to track down the reasons why systems can occasionally enter a period of non-linear growth. Eric Weiner (Reference 8) is one of those people, and his book The Geography Of Genius is a rattlingly good read. If you ever want to see what non-linear dynamics and the transient nature of success looks like in reality, you need look no further than this book. On one level it is a study of why, out of all of the cities and regions on the planet trying to be run successfully, the world occasionally throws up an Athens, or a Hangzhou, a Florence, an Edinburgh, a Vienna, or a Silicon Valley. Places that – for a fleeting moment – become a melting pot of change and innovation. It’s then also a look at why they stop being successful. But more than both of those things, it’s an attempt to understand at a first-principles level what are the unifying features of each of these regions. From a contradiction-finding perspective, the book is in effect all about one (root) contradiction: the desired emergent property was innovation and the thing that normally prevents it from happening – at least at a regional level – are the inherent difficulties to try and manage the right emergent outcomes. Abstracting this problem onto the terms of the Business Matrix, The Geography Of Genius is all about an Adaptability-versus-Control Complexity conflict. Having found the right problem, the next part of the reverse engineering process the SI team needed to work out was how each of the cities or regions successfully overcame the contradiction. Weiner’s final diagnosis is that in each case the success emerged from what he described as ‘3 D’s’: disorder, diversity and discernment. Respectively, when we interpret the intended meaning of each of these D’s, we find they correspond to Inventive Principles 13 &amp; 25 (disorder), 40 (diversity) and 21, 23 and 29 (discernment). And thus we have several entries that can be added to the tally for the Adaptability-versus-Control-Complexity box in the Matrix. One book, one contradiction, 6 Inventive Principles.</p>
<p><strong>Zappos</strong>: The Geography of Genius is something of an exception to the usual business text rule: someone who understands complexity and focuses on one problem. I suspect most business books are sparked by a hypothesis that turns into an article that grabs the attention of sufficient readers that a publisher comes along and says to the author, ‘any chance you could turn that into a book?’ the answer to which is usually, ‘yes, let me go and find a few cases that kind of fit my hypothesis’. Needless to say, it’s usually difficult to glean anything of value from such models. A subset of this model is the organization that successfully goes through a period of non-linear growth and gets approached directly by the publishers: ‘please could you write up your recipe for success?’. To which the answer is almost invariably, ‘yes’, since most CEOs have big egos. One such success (I can’t say anything too specific about ego, but I have my theory) is the online retailer Zappos. Prior to their acquisition by Amazon for $1.2B in 2009, Zappos achieved something that 99% of on-line retailers have thus far failed to do: make money. The Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh, was convinced to write the book, ‘Delivering Happiness’ in 2010 (Reference 9). When we read through it, we could see that Zappos had found a good contradiction to solve – ‘we want to increase customer revenues, but it’s difficult to make a decent margin when your route to market is virtual’ – but it wasn’t especially clear how the problem had been solved. Fortunately, when organisations become spectacularly successful, lots of outsiders start swarming to see if they can discern the secret elixir. Most of these didn’t help either. The Halo Effect seemed to be shining brightly. It wasn’t until we hit upon the book Holacracy (Reference 10) that we felt we really got to the crux of the contradiction’s resolution. Actually, first up it gave us a clearer insight into the actual contradiction, by revealing this quote from Hsieh: ‘Zappos is growing, we’ve reached fifteen hundred employees, and we need to scale without losing our entrepreneurial culture or getting bogged down in bureaucracy’. Thus the contradiction deepens, it has now become (in the terms of the Matrix) a Customer Revenue versus Adaptability/Versatility conflict. Having found a good problem, it then becomes important to look for evidence of step-change solutions that help to alleviate or eliminate the conflict at hand. Also in the Holacracy book, we find the story of the Zappos call centre operator that received a call from an apparently distraught customer who, having the week before bought a pair of shoes for her father, indicated that her father had passed away just after the shoes arrived and could she have a refund. Now, I’m not sure what you’re thinking when you read that story, but I know when I’ve spoken to friends and colleagues that have had occasion to frequent call centres, they’re more than skeptical about the sincerity of the caller. What the Zappos operator purportedly did is not only agreed the refund for the shoes but also, without asking a supervisor, organized a bunch of condolences flowers to be sent to the customer. The point here is not whether the story is true or not, but that it exists as a story. Stories tell us a lot about the culture of an organization. More importantly stories tell people inside the organization what the values of that organization are. And now we’re somewhere close to a ‘first principles’, ‘DNA’ level understanding of whether and how the contradiction has been solved. The story is about Inventive Principles 2 (Take Out the command and control), 7 (Nested workgroups – thanks to Holacracy for that one!) and, most important of all, 33 (‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’).</p>
<p><strong>3D-Printing</strong>: Once in a while, the whole contradiction story takes a 180degree turn. Sometimes the world generates terrific solutions that open up the possibility to solve multiple contradiction problems. One that is doing exactly that is 3D printing, or perhaps more generically, ‘additive manufacturing’. The shift from traditional ‘subtractive’ to additive manufacturing is an illustration of a classic Principle 13 solution – turn the system the other way around. It is also, to all intents and purposes a technical solution. Which seems to imply a degree of cheating to some people in the business community: ‘how can you use a technical example to illustrate a business method?’ seems to be the gist of the question. To which the answer is, ’it might be a technical solution, but it is a solution to a host of business problems. The artificial boundaries we seem to instinctively draw between different disciplines after a century of dominance by the specialists of the world are purely in our imagination. The issue as far as the Business Matrix is what business contradictions is additive manufacturing a solution to? When we look at successful deployments of the new way of doing things – aerospace, medical devices being two dominant areas, we can establish that the contradictions being solved include Production-Capability-versus-Adaptability, Production-Cost-versus-System-Complexity, Production Time-versus-Design-Specification. And so those are the boxes within the Matrix where Principle 13 is added to the running total of Principles found as solution strategies for that particular combination of improving and worsening features.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Roundabout</strong>: A bit more difficult to track down, but many of the best contradiction resolving solutions are ones that never got formally written up and published as a case study in a business text book. One of my favourite examples is the so-called ‘magic roundabout’ design found at several locations in the UK where there is a legacy infra-structure problem with multiple roads converging onto a point. The traditional solution to such situations is to construct a roundabout. Roundabouts are a good solution, because they are self-organising (Principle 25) in the sense that every individual driver decides when it’s safe to enter the roundabout. Put enough traffic into the system, however, and eventually gridlock will occur. Or at least it used to do prior to the realization of the roundabout-of-roundabouts idea (Principle 7). The contradiction being solved here, in business terms is the fight between the desire for more flow (Production Capability) and the parallel desire to avoid complicated control systems such as traffic lights (Control Complexity). There’s an argument here again that this is a technical problem with a technical solution, but hopefully the real point is that if the improving and worsening features can be mapped onto the Business Matrix – which they have been – then the case study is a valid one. If that doesn’t satisfy the more skeptical readers, then we might also look a level deeper at this problem. Whenever I show the image of the roundabout in countries outside the UK the usual reaction is one of, ‘that can’t be right’. When they see videos of cars travelling around the roundabout in both clock-wise and counter-clock-wise directions the reaction becomes somewhat stronger. Imagine you’re the chief roads planning officer for Swindon council – the place where the first magic roundabout was tried – and someone comes to you with the idea for the first time. Not only does the idea look wrong, but there’s no proof that it could be right. In this scenario there is a much deeper contradiction that needs to be solved, one that gets right to the heart of human emotions and intangibles, how to convince someone to try something new (Design Risk), when there is no tangible evidence it works (Amount Of Information) and it looks so counter-intuitive ((in)Competence)? Answer? The initial set up was designed as a classic (complex systems) ‘safe to fail’ experiment (Principle 27). The roundabout is merely paint on the road; if it hadn’t worked, it could have been painted back to the original form in a matter of hours. As it happens, there was no need for that as not only does it flow considerably more traffic than the conventional design, but it’s also significantly less prone to traffic accidents. Which tells us about another Inventive Principle being used – Principle 13 again – the best way to make people behave in a safe manner is to ensure their out of their ‘unconscious competence’ thinking mode, and the best way to achieve that is to make them feel ever so slightly unsure about what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5 Magic Roundabout, Swindon</strong></p>
<p><strong>US9,418,383</strong>: In theory at least, one of the best sources of contradiction-solving case studies are patent databases. In a typical week in the US – where business patents are ‘allowable’ – there will be several hundred newly granted patents pertaining to business issues. Admittedly, many of these are weak (according to our IP quality measurement tool, ApolloSigma – Reference 11), but even if 85% of the patents go straight into our trash-can, that still leaves a substantial number of cases per week to potentially add to the database. By way of an example, US9,418,383 was granted to State Farm Mutual Insurance in August 2016. One of the nicest parts of using the patent databases of the world as a source of case studies, is that inventors are supposed to describe the problem they have solved. Here’s what we learn from the US9,418,383 background description:</p>
<p><em>“Insurance customers typically buy a policy for a fixed amount of time and for particular coverage. For example, insurance customers apply for insurance by submitting to an evaluation of past or contemporary vehicle, driver, and other conditions and behaviour. The insurance company then evaluates these conditions to determine a risk of loss for the insurance company. The customer then pays a policy premium fee to bind the insurance for a period of time, typically six months, which is based on the determined risk of loss. A higher fee is based on a higher risk of loss, and vice-versa. If, during the insured time period, the customer experiences no loss incidents, the customer may have an opportunity to renew the insurance policy at a lower premium. Thus, any benefit for the customer in reducing the possibility of loss incidents (i.e., engaging in risk-reducing behaviour) occurs upon renewing the policy.”</em></p>
<p>Finding the contradiction requires a little bit of unravelling, but when we do that job, and map it onto the parameters of the Matrix, we see a conflict between the desire on the part of State Farm to improve the flexibility (Adaptability/Versatility) of their pricing being inhibited by the fact that traditionally insurance policies are only renewed on an annual basis (Supply Time). In terms of how the Company has solved the problem, we need to look elsewhere in the patent document. Usually the Claims section. Where, in this case we’re told:</p>
<p><em>“A computer-implemented method for providing disincentives to an insured customer during the term of an insurance policy, the method comprising: receiving, via a computer network, sensor data from at least one sensor, the sensor data (i) including data that measures a set of characteristics of an operating insured vehicle, and (ii) sent by the at least one sensor in real time during operation of the operating insured vehicle; accessing vehicle conditions data including data related to an environment at a particular location; once the sensor data is received from the at least one sensor: determining, based on the vehicle conditions data, that the operating insured vehicle is operating at the particular location, and determining, based on the vehicle conditions data and the sensor data, that the insured customer is engaging in risk-increasing behaviour; calculating a risk score for the insured customer, the risk score based on the risk-increasing behaviour engaged in by the insured customer; determining, by a processor, a disincentive action to execute for the insured customer based on the risk score; and executing, by the processor, the disincentive action.”</em></p>
<p>Which, when we plough through the legalese and map the inventive steps onto the taxonomy of Inventive Principles we see evidence of Principles 15 (Dynamics), 23 (Feedback), 35 (Parameter Changes – i.e.&nbsp;the sensors – which, on deeper reading turn out to be wireless, and making use of the ‘cloud’). And again, we have three more entries to add to the Adaptability-Supply-Time box.</p>
<p>And there we have it. Repeat these kinds of analysis 750,000 more times and you have the Matrix that unfolds before you.</p>
<p>That’s as far as the story goes for the Contradiction Matrix. For the sake of completeness, every case study we look at goes through a more comprehensive process of analysis and mapping on to the wider Systematic Innovation methodology frameworks and databases. Here’s what that broader process consists of for each patent, journal paper or business text book we deem worthy of analysis:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>look up pulse rate of relevant industry</p></li>
<li><p>identify evidence of failure or success plus or minus one/two pulses 3) look for evidence of trend jumps (Evolution Potential – Reference 5) and/or contradictions solved (in practical terms, these days, we know that if neither of these has happened, it won’t be a successful solution, so this is actually the easier and better test)</p></li>
<li><p>If 3) is positive, look for evidence of new trends or trend jumps, reverse engineer the contradiction and add to Matrix, new Principles? new function database entry? New Inventive Standard? (Reference 12)</p></li>
<li><p>If the attempt is a failure: classify the type of failure (wrong solution, wrong problem, inadequate coordination, route to market, means of production, wrong measurement) in order to keep the overall failure rate statistics up to date.</p></li>
<li><p>If the attempt is a success: does the success make sense in terms of Voice of System matching Voice of Customer matching Voice of Execution - if it doesn’t, does the model need to change/evolve? (Reference 5)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 6 summarises the overall process:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6 Overall Business Innovation Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A detailed description of the overall strategy can be found in Reference 12, but a few important points are discussed here: First, the start point of the analysis is to examine every incoming piece of ‘new’ content. Anyone who has spent any time looking at patents or read more than their fair share of business texts will have very quickly learned that there is a lot of information that – to put it kindly – has little of value to contribute to mankind’s greater well-being. Statistically, around 95% of business texts end up with large proportions of the first (and only) edition being pulped. Around 97% of patents never pay back the cost of filing the patent. On average we reject about 85% of books, papers and patents after establishing the Quality of Invention, thus focusing on extracting knowledge from the top 15%. There is a significant possibility of missing important material by rejecting this proportion of information. We minimise this risk through the use of in-house semantic search strategies and developed metrics (relating things such as length of claims, number of certain keywords found within claims, number of citations and time from submission to grant). These have evolved to become highly effective filter tools.</p>
<p>By archiving the actual words used by the inventor (rather than just the generic Parameter names) it becomes possible to re-arrange the data to suit different definitions of the Parameter names. This is something that may be utilised by different industry sectors who want to possess a Matrix specific to their own terminology.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, there is often a degree of uncertainty over the specific conflict pair an inventor or author has sought to tackle – for example if the inventor is attempting to solve multiple problems. In these situations, the strategy is to place details of the invention in all of the Matrix boxes that appear to be relevant. This multiple placement of solutions within the Matrix ensures that users will obtain the highest quality recommendations, as the uncertainties we have deciding where to put a particular invention are exactly the same as the uncertainties users will face deciding which conflict pair is most relevant to their problem. By including the uncertainties during the data input stage, an imperfect selection by a user will still identify Inventive Principles that have been used to successfully challenge ‘similar’ situations.</p>
<p>As a final test of the validity of the Matrix recommendations we have had an ‘expert panel’ test each individual box. For each conflict pair at least two specific case studies are generated. For each of these cases, the expert panel brainstorms through the 40 Inventive Principles in order to generate as many solution options as possible, These are then evaluated with a view to identify which of the ideas gave the ‘best’ solution strategy. ‘Best’ is defined as those solution concepts that contained the most significant ‘wow’ factor, or presented the most elegant solution. On average it has taken around 4 hours to go through this process for each box in the Matrix. Multiply that number by the number of boxes (just short of 2000), and you obtain an indication of the overall level of effort that has been expended to create the tool in its latest form.</p>

<section id="intangibles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intangibles">Intangibles</h2>
<p>And so we reach the heart of the step-change realised between the second edition of the Business Matrix and this third one: intangibles. We’d known since we started using the J.P. Morgan aphorism, ‘a man makes a decision for two reasons: a good reason and a real reason’, back in the late 1980s that you can’t hope to truly solve a people-related problem unless you bear in mind the feelings and emotions of those people with a stake in the problem. This was around the time a lot of business books were declaring, ‘don’t take it personally, it’s just business’. All our instincts (and experience managing large teams) told us that any attempt to separate business and what people felt about business was doomed to failure. We knew too, shortly after beginning our TRIZ journey that the absence of intangible factors was a big limitation on our ability to sensibly make use of the toolkit in a ‘business’ context. The problem at that time was that there were very few visible examples of businesses and business leaders seeking to bring emotional factors into play during their problem solving activities. So there was no real ‘database’ of examples to draw from. And certainly no database of ‘intangible-related’ contradictions we might use to begin populating an expanded Business Matrix. It wasn’t even possible to construct with any kind of clarity what emotion-oriented parameters we should try and build into the ‘improving’ and ‘worsening’ dimensions of the Matrix. The best we were able to do in fact, if you look at either the first or second editions of the tool was to bundle all of the ‘emotion’ problems into a category called ‘tension/stress’.</p>
<p>The first breakthrough appeared when we started connecting the J.P. Morgan aphorism to the TRIZ ‘function’ pillar and pioneered the ‘Outcome Map’:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7 Prototype Outcome Map</strong></p>
<p>Half of this Map was about forcing to think about intangibles: firstly what are the intangible outcomes desired by the individual customer and then what are the ones desired by the people around that individual. We knew from our work with pioneering clients in this ‘intangibles domain (largely FMCG and tourism industry enterprises) that it wasn’t possible to go and ask these people about the intangible ’stuff’ directly. There’s no question, for example, a marketing person can sensibly formulate to ask a prospective customer, ‘how cool do you want to be?’ Or, ‘how much do you want your friends to look up to you?’ We all know these elements are present to some extent whenever people are present, but how many of them need to be taken into consideration? Are there thousands of emotions that need to be thought about, or a handful?</p>
<p>It was time to get back to first principles. In classic TRIZ, ‘someone, somewhere already solved your problem’ mode, it didn’t take long to find Reference 13. Deci &amp; Ryan’s work tells us that our core human emotion drivers are Autonomy, Belonging and Competence: parallel desires to be in control of a situation, to be part of the ‘tribe’ and to be able to demonstrate to ourselves and others that we are ‘good at’ whatever we’re doing, respectively. Then came David Rock’s SCARF model (References 14 and 15). Then, really getting back to the first of first principles, Edward Matchett tells us that ‘Meaning’ is the ultimate human driver (Reference 16). And so we ended up with the ABC-M prototype:</p>
<p><strong>Figure 8 Autonomy-Belonging-Competence-Meaning (ABC-M) First-Principle Human Behaviour Drivers</strong></p>
<p>Now we had a foundation, not just for doing a more comprehensive job of helping problem solving teams to ‘complete’ their Outcome Maps, but also for a taxonomy of parameters we needed to include in this 3.0 version of the Business Matrix.</p>
<p>Once we knew ABC-M were important, we knew we had to find ways in which to identify and measure them. That’s where our spin-out company, PanSensic now comes in to play. PanSensic (Reference 17) is all about measuring what’s important rather than what’s merely easy. Most organisations, we quickly saw when we started going to visit enterprise executives in order to understand what they’d ‘really like to know’ about the world around them, had fallen into the latter trap. It’s easy to measure whether the train left the station on time; it’s much more difficult to give a commuter live information about the quickest way to get to their intended destination, but only the latter is of any use.</p>
<p>The other frequently heard responses to the ‘really like to know’ question are the other parameters you will now find in the ‘Intangibles’ cluster in the Matrix: Sense Of Progress, Trust, and Engagement. And then there were a large number of other parameters that we hear a lot less frequently. These are things that we’ve had to cluster together in a final pair of parameters, ‘Positive Intangibles’ and ‘Negative Intangibles’. We were forced to do this, too, because its far less easy to find a critical mass of case studies to enable inclusion of a new parameter. One imagines that as the research continues, future versions of the Matrix will see these two ‘catch-all’ categories disappearing and being replaced by a more granular list of parameters. Except, by that stage, we envisage that the Matrix software technology will have evolved to the point where users will not have to concern themselves with the parameters at all since a software tool will directly identify contradictions and conflicts and offer up some immediate Inventive Principle solution directions (see the final chapter of the book for more details of this evolution trajectory).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the last three years, we have had our own research version of a PanSensic ‘Contradiction Finder’ and so the process of finding case studies has increased in speed by two orders of magnitude. Consequently, it has been possible to take ‘obscure’ conflicts between, say, Autonomy and Engagement, set the software off trawling through social media looking for examples of where this conflict is occurring, and then allow the researcher to dig deeper and see when and, more importantly, how managers and leaders are successfully solving the conflict to create breakthrough solutions. As the software gets better at doing this translation-to-solution job itself, we expect the rate of case study mapping to increase by another exponential leap.</p>
<p>There’s an oft used expression in China: ‘when all else is equal, you buy from your friends,’ which later concludes, ‘when all else is unequal, you still buy from your friends.’ Business, in other words, is largely dominated by the intangible factors. J.P. Morgan was right, we do make decisions for two reasons, but it’s the (intangible) real reason that sets the whole story in motion.</p>
